# Recursive Caesar Cipher Algorithm

This repository provides two Python implementations of the Caesar Cipher algorithm: one utilizing recursion and the other employing iteration. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

## About

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. In this repository, both recursive and iterative methods are provided to demonstrate different approaches to implementing the cipher.

## Features

- **Recursive Implementation**: Encrypt and decrypt messages using a recursive approach.
- **Iterative Implementation**: Encrypt and decrypt messages using an iterative approach.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Both encryption and decryption functionalities are provided.
- **Alphabet Wrapping**: Handles wrapping around the alphabet correctly during encryption and decryption.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cosalt/Recursive-Caesar-Cipher-Algorithm.git
